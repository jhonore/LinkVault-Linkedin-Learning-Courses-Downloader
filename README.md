LinkedVault is a Windows-first desktop application for collecting, organizing,
reading, and studying content you are allowed to access. It combines course
archiving, newspaper retrieval and offline reading, and durable clipping notes
in one local workspace.

The product name is intentionally broader than the original repository slug:
LinkedVault is not limited to course downloads.

## What You Can Do

- Download course videos into a folder you choose.
- Save subtitles, exercise files, quiz notes, and a readable `Study.md` guide when available.
- Queue multiple course links and track progress in one place.
- Retry failed downloads without rebuilding the whole list.
- Save your cookie once, then reuse it for future launches.
- Keep data local to your machine.
- Download daily, weekly, and discovered special World Journal editions.
- Schedule newspaper batches with a configurable delay between editions.
- Optimize newspaper pages as high-clarity WebP while safely retaining originals when needed.
- Browse shallow front-page previews and read downloaded editions offline.
- Register an existing Newspaper Extractor archive without moving its files.
- Clip part of a newspaper page into a durable snapshot.
- Write, format, search, and autosave Markdown notes attached to clippings.
- Recover note edits across close, restart, and interrupted-save scenarios.

## Supported providers

- **LinkedIn Learning** — course videos, subtitles, exercise files, quizzes,
  and study guides when the authenticated source makes them available.
- **Coursera** — course downloads through the native Coursera workflow.
- **World Journal** — edition discovery, scheduled retrieval, page
  optimization, offline reading, and newspaper clippings.

Provider integrations depend on upstream sites and may require maintenance as
their authentication or delivery formats change.

## How To Use

1. Install LinkedVault with the Windows installer.
2. Open LinkedVault.
3. Paste one or more LinkedIn Learning course URLs.
4. Choose the download folder and quality.
5. Paste your LinkedIn `li_at` cookie once, or use a supported browser session.
6. Click **Download**.

Queued courses are persisted independently of the current LinkedIn session. If
the saved `li_at` cookie expires, LinkedVault keeps the queue and shows a
**Resume queue** action after you paste a fresh cookie. Right-click any queued
course row to copy its normalized course URL for safekeeping or retrying later.

For newspapers, open **World Journal → Download editions**, select editions and
dates, then choose **Download** or **Add schedule**. Scheduled work appears in
the **Queue** section (with **Completed** and **Failed** for history). There are
no separate Schedule or History tabs. Completed and partial editions also appear
under **Newspaper library**.

Your downloads are saved into the folder you picked. Your saved session is protected with Windows encryption and stored locally.

## Requirements

Both platforms:

- Node.js with npm (Node 20.19+ or 22.12+ recommended; Node 22.6+ is needed by
  the `--experimental-strip-types` verify scripts)
- Rust toolchain (MSRV **1.77.2**)

Windows, the supported target:

- Microsoft C++ Build Tools or Visual Studio Build Tools
- Microsoft WebView2 Runtime

macOS, development only (see [Run Locally (macOS)](#run-locally-macos)):

- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`); `rusqlite` is built
  bundled and `webp` compiles C sources, so a C compiler is required
- Nothing further: Tauri 2 uses the system WKWebView

## Technology

- Rust and Tauri for the native desktop shell, provider workflows, persistence,
  scheduling, downloads, and Windows integration.
- React, TypeScript, and Vite for the desktop interface.
- SQLite for durable local application state.

## Privacy and responsible use

LinkedVault is designed for local archives. Saved sessions are protected with
Windows encryption and application data stays on the machine unless you copy
it elsewhere. Do not use LinkedVault to bypass DRM, paid access controls,
robots.txt restrictions, rate limits, or a provider's terms. Only download,
scrape, archive, or share material you have permission to access.

The project is not affiliated with LinkedIn, Coursera, World Journal, or any
other content provider.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Start with
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Before changing provider behavior, read the
ownership and persistence contracts in
[`docs/architecture`](docs/architecture/README.md) and the invariants in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). For newspaper clippings, the native Tauri window is
required; the frontend-only preview cannot prove native persistence, window,
tray, or input behavior.

## Run Locally

Use this when you want to work on the app from source.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Howard-Starfield/LinkVault-Linkedin-Learning-Courses-Downloader.git LinkedVault
cd LinkedVault
npm --prefix apps\desktop install
npm run dev
```

If PowerShell blocks `npm.ps1`, either run this once:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

or use the `.cmd` shim:

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev
```

The desktop app opens from Tauri. The Vite frontend runs at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:1420
```

Stop the development app with `Ctrl+C` in the terminal that launched it.

### Run Locally (macOS)

macOS is a **development-only** target: there is no macOS CI, no `.app`/`.dmg`
bundle, and two providers do not function. Check the support table before you
start.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Howard-Starfield/LinkVault-Linkedin-Learning-Courses-Downloader.git LinkedVault
cd LinkedVault
make doctor     # checks node, rust, Xcode CLT, Chrome
make install
make dev
```

`make` is the root entry point on every platform; `make help` lists every
target. The `npm run ...` commands elsewhere in this document still work, because
the root `package.json` forwards to the same targets.

#### What works on macOS

| Area | Works | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Window, UI, tray, "open folder" button | Yes | |
| SQLite, migrations, clipping notes, crop pipeline | Yes | |
| Newspaper provider (World Journal) | Yes | |
| LinkedIn and Coursera sessions | Partly | Pasting a session token works: `app::dpapi` now seals it with AES-256-GCM under a key held in the login keychain. Importing cookies from an installed browser does **not** — Chromium cookie decryption needs DPAPI and returns nothing off Windows. |
| YouTube provider | **No** | Helper binaries are pinned to the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` triple and the process supervisor is Windows-only. |

On macOS the archive is written to `~/Library/Application Support/LinkedVault`
instead of sitting next to the executable. The portable default would land inside
`src-tauri/target`, where `make clean` would destroy it. The Makefile exports
`LINKVAULT_DATA_DIR` for you; set it yourself to move the archive elsewhere.

### Diagnostic session log

Off by default. When enabled, LinkedVault writes one JSONL file per launch under
`<data dir>/logs`, recording navigation, button presses, every call to the Rust
backend with its duration and outcome, and every toast. It is meant to be read
after the fact — by you or by an assistant — to work out what happened without
reproducing it.

```bash
make dev-debug     # run with the log enabled
make logs          # print the newest session
make logs-path     # just the path
```

The ten most recent sessions are kept; older ones are deleted at startup.

Secrets never reach the file. Events have no free-form payload field, and every
string is scrubbed for session cookies, tokens and authorization headers before
it is written. Even so, the log does record which screens you opened and which
actions you took, so treat a session file as personal before sharing it.

### Developer test: Newspaper Clippings

Run this test in the native Tauri window, not the frontend-only browser preview.
Desktop commands, managed snapshot files, and native input behavior require the
Tauri runtime.

Before testing, make sure **World Journal → Newspaper library** contains at
least one downloaded edition with a readable completed page.

1. Open an edition, choose **Clip**, and drag over part of one newspaper page.
   Confirm that the selection follows the pointer, then choose **Save clipping**.
   The reader must remain open and offer **Open note** after the save succeeds.
2. Open **World Journal → Clippings**. At the default desktop width, confirm
   that four thumbnails fit on each row. Resize the window and confirm that the
   responsive column count changes without stretching the crop. Thumbnails
   should replace their placeholders without flashing back to an empty image.
3. Hover a thumbnail. Only its image should enlarge slightly; the card must not
   jump upward. Select the thumbnail to open its separate note page.
4. Confirm the detail page has a compact **Back** action with the editable note
   title beside it, no search box, and no boxed editor card. The saved crop
   should be the large read-only header above its provenance and note body.
   Save state plus Undo/Redo belong in the bottom-right note footer.
5. At the start of a paragraph or after a space, type `/`. Confirm the popup is
   visible above the note, then filter it and exercise **Text**,
   **To-do list**, **Heading 1–4**, **Bullet list**, **Numbered list**,
   **Quote**, and **Divider** with both pointer selection and the arrow keys
   plus `Enter`. Confirm `/h` selects **Heading 1**, `/todo` selects
   **To-do list**, `/hr` selects **Divider**, and a close typo such as
   `/heding` still ranks **Heading 1** first without executing it automatically.
6. Drag across note text with the left mouse button. No formatting toolbar
   should appear during the drag. After release, it should appear above the
   selection, aligned with the first selected word. Check **Bold**, **Italic**,
   **Strikethrough**, and **Link**.
7. Paste plain text, then try pasting an image or file. Text must remain usable;
   image/file paste must be rejected without replacing the saved clipping.
8. Edit the title and note, wait for **Saved**, choose **Back**, and reopen the
   clipping. Confirm that the title, Markdown formatting, and note content were
   persisted. Optionally repeat typing with a Chinese IME to verify native
   composition does not duplicate or lose committed text.
9. Open that clipping's snapshot directory. Confirm `note.md` sits beside
   `clipping-v1.webp` and contains the saved Markdown. SQLite remains canonical:
   editing `note.md` externally is not imported and may be overwritten by the
   next save or startup repair.
10. Use the Clippings search box. Search separately for words found in the title,
   note, edition, date, and page. Confirm the matching field tags are correct,
   lower-confidence results are separated as **Possible matches**, and more
   results load while scrolling. The search box must remain exclusive to the
   gallery/search surface.
11. In **Settings → Snapshot locations**, confirm the derived root is connected.
    On disk, the clipping belongs under the same newspaper download destination
    at `Newspaper snapshots/<edition>/`; Settings must not offer an arbitrary
    global snapshot-folder override.
12. Add a unique title/body suffix and click the window **X** before the footer
    reaches **Saved**. The window should hide instead of exiting. Choose
    **Show LinkedVault** from the tray, reopen the clipping, and confirm the exact
    suffix is canonical or appears in the explicit recovery state. There must
    still be only one main window.
13. Type continuously, click **X** while the footer says **Saving…**, then show
    LinkedVault from the tray. Confirm the newest text—not an earlier keystroke—is
    present. Repeat the hide/show cycle once to catch duplicate close handlers.
14. While LinkedVault is running, launch it again from the Start menu or installed
    executable. Confirm the existing window is shown and focused, Task Manager
    still reports one `linkvault.exe`, and the current clipping note remains
    visible after its durability flush/refresh.
15. Add another unique suffix and immediately choose **Quit** from the tray.
    Relaunch LinkedVault and confirm the exact latest text is saved or explicitly
    offered for recovery. Tray Quit must exit; window X must only hide.
16. Do not use Task Manager against a real user database to test crash recovery.
    Forced-termination and injected save/checkpoint failures belong to the
    isolated automated harness or a disposable test profile.

Focused automated checks for this workflow:

```powershell
npm --prefix apps\desktop run verify:clipping-note-editor-markdown
npm --prefix apps\desktop run verify:clipping-note-editor
npm --prefix apps\desktop run verify:clipping-note-autosave
npm --prefix apps\desktop run verify:clipping-note-lifecycle
npm --prefix apps\desktop run verify:clipping-note-durability-structure
npm --prefix apps\desktop run verify:clipping-note-durability-browser
npm --prefix apps\desktop run verify:newspaper-clipping-library
```

## Architecture

Backend ownership, the unified workflow decision, and the provider migration
roadmap live only under
[`docs/architecture`](docs/architecture/README.md) — that directory is the
source of truth (there is no separate root `ARCHITECTURE.md`). Read that
contract before adding a provider, queue, scheduler, background worker, or
persisted job state.

## Build The App

Use this when you want a production executable or Windows installer.

```powershell
npm run tauri -- build
```

Production outputs:

```text
apps\desktop\src-tauri\target\release\linkvault.exe
apps\desktop\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\LinkedVault_<version>_x64-setup.exe
```

## Publish An Update

The release workflow runs when you push a version tag like `vX.Y.Z`. It builds the Windows installer, creates a GitHub release, and uploads `latest.json` for the in-app updater.
Tags with a prerelease suffix, such as `vX.Y.Z-rc.1`, are published as GitHub prereleases and do not replace the stable `latest` release.

1. Bump the version in `apps/desktop/package.json`, `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
2. Run:

```powershell
npm run build
npm run cargo:test
```

3. Commit and push the version bump.
4. Create and push the tag:

```powershell
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Users on older signed builds can use the in-app update button after the GitHub release finishes.

## Frontend-Only Preview

This is useful for UI work, but desktop-only features need Tauri.

```powershell
npm run web:dev
# open:
http://127.0.0.1:1420
```

## Verify A Release

Useful checks before sharing a build:

```powershell
npm run cargo:test
npm run verify:visual
npm run verify:ui
npm run verify:release
npm run verify:installer
npm run verify:release-manifest
```
